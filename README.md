# MergeProject
A physics-based casual puzzle game where players drop and merge objects to evolve them into higher-tier items. The goal is to reach the final "Trophy" item without overflowing the container.

Gameplay & Features
* **Merge Mechanics:** Drop items into a container. When two identical items touch, they merge into a larger, more valuable item.
* **Physics Simulation:** Objects react to gravity and collisions realistically, creating unpredictable and fun situations.
* **Shop & Abilities:** Players can purchase boosters to unstuck items and clear space.
* **Themes:** Multiple item sets available (Detective, Sport, etc.).

Technical Highlights
* **Monetization (IAP):** Integrated Unity IAP / custom asset to handle real-money transactions for in-game currency/abilities.
* **Physics 2D:** Tuned rigidbodies and colliders to ensure stable stacking without performance drops.
* **UI Toolkit/UGUI:** Responsive interface for the Shop and Settings menus.
